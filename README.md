# Multi Vendor Network Labs at Karneliuk.com
During our work as employees or varios external projects we conduct a huge amount of various network lab activities. Some of them we use during various blogposts, some of them during trainings, etc.

*For sure, some of labs are private when we are bound by NDA. Those stay private futher.*

We decided to create this repository with labs and topologies we are building so that you can also benefit, if you are facing similar tasks in your professional live and struggle to find accurate information.

## Disclaimer
The labs provided as-is, as for this specific labs we are not building detailed lab guides. You can think about it more as configuration reposiotry with step-by-step configuration to achieve a certain goal, rather than a pure study materials.

## Structure
Labs are structure in a per-vendor format. However, if the lab touches multiple vendors, the directory would be named after multiple vendors.
